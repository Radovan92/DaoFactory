* The DaoFactory smart contract is developed in order to provide users with the ability to create their own DAO without the need for mediator.

* The idea behind it is to make Octus Bridge even more decentralized by giving every user the possibility to manipulate their own DAO in their own manners.

* The DaoFactory contract deploys an existing Octus Bridge contract - DaoRoot this making integration with the Octus Bridge very simple.
